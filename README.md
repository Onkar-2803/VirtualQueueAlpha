# VirtualQueue
Motivation: 
"The average person will spend 10 years standing in line over their lifetime!"- The Times Of India.
Queues are a common sight today irrespective of the purpose. It has been proven by many scientific studies that queues are a source of psychological discomfort and unproductivity.
With the ageing population of India, the elderly will also be present in ever greater numbers. It is troubling for the elderly to queue for long periods while standing or sitting and remaining stationary in their spot. For very long physical queues, there will be crowd control costs incurred.	
For restaurants and cafes, where it tends to be very packed, there is a high risk of knocking onto people carrying fragile stuff or hot food, and this could be dangerous. For crowded canteens or food courts, there are also chances of mixing up the queues for adjacent stores to join for the customers. This can be applied to ad-hoc events as well, where they have different queues for different purposes but are put next to each other.


Survey: 
A small survey was conducted by us which included nearby shopkeepers as vendors and our relatives and friends as customers who gave us an idea about the situation during the pandemic and the inconvenience caused to them. Customers had to wait in long queues by maintaining social distance which usually consumed their lot of time and also exposed them to other people which made them more prone to be infectedd by COVID-19.


Our Solution:
Virtual Queue serves to eliminate the problem of physical queues by implementing a user-friendly interface for users to find and join queues easily as well as help in getting the directions to the particular shop and exit the queue at any point of time. Our Virtual Queue system allows users to be both customers and merchants.
